üî±: Installation Guide
---
- After Cloning the Github repository (git clone https://github.com/Swaranjali167/Jobify) to a desired location on your computer. Please follow the steps given below to set up the project to a working condition.

### Now with support for docker-compose! 
If you don't want to download mysql, or XAMPP locally, all you need is Docker installed to do these steps. 

- the only file you'll need to edit is [here](./code/Scraper/main.py) for the admins email id and password
- in the root directory, run:
  ```
  docker-compose up
  ```
  and then head over to http://localhost:8080 and your application is up and running! 

### Traditional installation
- Host your MySQL DB using an application by following these steps.
  * **Create a MySQL instance in your local** 
    + [Installation instruction for local](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/#mysql-getting-started-installing)
  or
  * **Create a MySQL instance in AWS**
    + [Installation instruction AWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng_zi11N4_c)
- Execute Jobify/code/Database/schema/srijas.sql file in the created db
- Update your DB credentials in the db.properties.template file.
- Provide executable permissions for setup.sh and execute the file.
- Update the admin's email ID and password in the main.py file for sending job notification mail.

This will install all the required packages from requirements.txt and create a parameters.json file which is required for accessing the DB.
- You can either choose to host the project on any online hosting platform or use an application to test the application locally. We used two applications to host the webpage in local -> XAMPP and MAMP Pro
  * [MAMP Pro](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)
    + [Installation instructions](https://documentation.mamp.info/en/MAMP-PRO-Mac/)
  * [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
    + If you wish to use XAMPP, download the application and click on the Config button (see picture below)
    
      <img width="607" alt="xampp-conf" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28624935/143979475-f2d4b1d6-297c-43ff-8cb5-d243e59ebc57.png">
    + Click the Apache(httpd.conf) file and add the your project's directory under "DocumentRoot:"
      ```
        DocumentRoot ".../Jobify/code/Web_app"
        <Directory ".../Jobify/code/Web_app">
      ```
- After setting up the project, create executable permissions for the following files - run_notifier.sh and start_server.sh
  * To run the job notifier once -> execute run_notifier.sh
  * To run the scheduler -> execute start_server.sh

- You should be good to start working on the application now.

## Testing

We use pytest to perform testing on all unit tests together. The command needs to be run from the home directory of the project. The command is:
```
python -m pytest test/
```

## Code Coverage

Code coverage is part of the build. Every time new code is pushed to the repository, the build is run, and along with it, code coverage is computed. This can be viewed by selecting the build, and then choosing the codecov pop-up on hover.

Locally, we use the coverage package in python for code coverage. The commands to check code coverage in python are as follows:

```
coverage run -m pytest test/
coverage report
```

## :page_facing_up: Why
In a dynamic job market where opportunities abound, navigating through the myriad of job platforms can be overwhelming for job seekers. Just as the ubiquity of internet access has transformed the retail landscape, the job market has seen a similar shift, making it easier for individuals to explore job opportunities without geographic limitations.

Consider the following points:

1. **Changing Landscape of Job Market:** The job market, much like the retail sector, has experienced significant changes. The growth of e-commerce, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has reshaped the way people work, mirroring the shift in consumer behavior seen in the retail sector.

2. **Evolving Customer Expectations:** Just as e-commerce has altered customer expectations in retail, the job market now demands a personalized approach. Job seekers expect platforms to provide tailored services, similar to how e-commerce platforms personalize communications and offer a range of choices.

3. **Intense Competition:** The surge in e-commerce has led to intense competition, reflected in price patterns and frequent discounts. Similarly, the job market is highly competitive, with job seekers often grappling with the challenge of finding the best opportunities among a plethora of options.

4. **Efficiency and Ease of Use:** In the world of e-commerce, finding the best deals can be a hassle due to cutthroat competition. This challenge is mirrored in the job market, where job seekers face the task of sifting through numerous platforms to identify the most suitable opportunities.

This is where **Jobify** steps in:

- **Streamlining Job Hunting:** Jobify simplifies the job hunting process by offering an easy-to-use, all-in-one-place solution. It aims to reduce the hassle of finding the best job opportunities among various platforms, just as Slash does for finding the best deals in e-commerce.

- **Accessible to Students and Developers:** Initially tailored for students seeking the best deals, Jobify is versatile and can be used by anyone willing to develop an application that consumes job-related APIs. It opens up possibilities for developers to create custom applications on top of these APIs, extending its utility beyond its initial scope.

- **Future-Ready:** Jobify's future scope includes the potential for a web application with a frontend or mobile applications for Android and iOS that utilize its backend APIs. This adaptability ensures that Jobify remains relevant and can be seamlessly integrated into various applications, providing a forward-looking solution for the evolving job market.
